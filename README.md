# Game Prototype 

This project has been created with the sake of mastering SFML and building organized game engine with the proper structure and subcomponents. Many things will be reiterated over and continuously improved as I keep learning better ways to do stuff.

Many concepts, implementations and ideas will come from several books I'm currently reading:

* [Game coding complete, fourth edition](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Coding-Complete-Fourth-McShaffry/dp/1133776574)
* [SFML Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/SFML-Essentials-Milcho-G-Milchev/dp/1784397326)
* [SDL Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/SDL-Game-Development-Black-White/dp/1849696829)
* [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom-ebook/dp/B00P5URD96/ref=pd_sim_351_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=0T6WAM8JV701Q53WEPTZ)

The project depends on SFML. Make sure to follow official documentation on installing SFML for your own IDE.
